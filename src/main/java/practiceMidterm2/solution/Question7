Write an HTTP POST request to the server (www.university.edu) to fetch
courses.html. Use 1.1 version of HTTP protocol. Pass two parameters:
• semester with the value of Fall
• year with the value of 2024

Solution: (note that Content-Type and Content-Length are required parts of the
header, but it is ok if  you did not write them in the solution (and I put 30 as content length randomly),
this question focused on the fact that parameters are passed in the body of the POST request
(here we have a header, then an empty line, then the body).

POST /courses.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.university.edu
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 30

semester=Fall&year=2024
